- Added method getGameTimeLeft() (msek until end of game)

SICS TAC AgentWare Beta 6 (released 2002-07-22)
-----------------------------------------------

  requested but not yet received (and getOwn() not yet updated).

  been received for the bid.
- Fixed so that a transacted bid (when bidString gets non-empty)

SICS TAC AgentWare Beta 4 (released 2002-07-02)
-----------------------------------------------

SICS TAC AgentWare Beta 3 (released 2002-06-26)
-----------------------------------------------
- AgentImpl is now an abstract class.
- New method: quoteUpdated(int auctionCategory).
  Called when all quotes for a specific category of auctions
  have been updated.
- getStatusAsString in Quote has been renamed to getAuctionStatusAsString.
- getTypeAsString in TACAgent has been renamed to getAuctionTypeAsString.
- Hotel quotes are now requested as soon as they are updated
  instead of each 30 seconds (hotel quotes are known to be
  updated once per minute, on the minute).
- TACAgent can handle startup with support for arguments and config file.
- Generates separate log files for each game.

Note: the API has changed. To upgrade a Beta 2 agent to Beta 3:

1. The agent must extend AgentImpl, not implement it, since
   AgentImpl now is an abstract class.

2. AgentImpl contains a variable called 'agent' that the agent
   can use to access the TACAgent agent ware.

3. The initialization is now done with the method
   'init(se.sics.tac.util.ArgEnumerator args)' instead of
   'init(TACAgent agent)'. During initialization (and only then)
   it is possible to access program arguments with 'args' and
   options from the config file with
   'agent.getConfig(<configName>,<defaultValue>)'.

- bug fixes in communication with server (more robust)
- '-nogui' argument for agent to run without GUI
